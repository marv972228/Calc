# Java State Machine Calculator

## About
Java SM implementation of a basic calculator. I took the course COP 4380 Summer 2016 @ Florida State University with Dr. Robert Lacher as the professor. We studied the book "Practical UML Statecharts C/C++" by Miro Samek. 
The inspiration for the Java Calc program is from: figure 2.18 "The final calculator statechart" pp 97.  
The main goal of this project was to gain experience with state machine patterns as well as implement a physical calculator available at any store.
