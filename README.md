# Calc

About:
  
  Java SM implementation of a basic calculator. I took the course COP 4380 Summer 2016 @ Florida State University and studied the book
  Practical UML Statecharts by Miro Samek. 
  
  The inspiration for the Java Calc program is from: figure 2.18 "The final calculator statechart" pp 97. 
  
  The Java Calc has some design changes as I implemented a memory function and exponent.
